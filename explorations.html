<h2 id="board">Board Game Exploration</h2>
<p>When I was first assigned this exploration to complete with my group, the first step was to pick a game that we wanted to be inspired by. The game we wanted to resemble was Monopoly. In this case, we wanted to pic a board that was similar to it in a way. To be more creative and fun, we included different gamepieces that could be easily differentiated when playing the game. 
 Our player pieces include different things like lego humans and dinosaurs. 
 Similar to Monopoly, the pieces will move the same which is forward only from the start point to the end point. 
 Unlike monopoly, there would be no assets for us to collect during the game. The player is meant to get to the end/finish line first before the other players and the fun in this is the anticipation. 
 Another main component of the game being used is the dice which determines how many spaces a play piece can move.
