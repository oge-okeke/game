<h2 id="board">Board Game Exploration</h2>
<p>When I was first assigned this exploration to complete with my group, the first step was to pick a game that we wanted to be inspired by. The game we wanted to resemble was Monopoly. In this case, we wanted to pic a board that was similar to it in a way. To be more creative and fun, we included different gamepieces that could be easily differentiated when playing the game. 
 Our player pieces include different things like lego humans and dinosaurs. 
 Similar to Monopoly, the pieces will move the same which is forward only from the start point to the end point. 
 Unlike monopoly, there would be no assets for us to collect during the game. The player is meant to get to the end/finish line first before the other players and the fun in this is the anticipation. 
 Another main component of the game being used is the dice which determines how many spaces a play piece can move. 
</p>

        <h2> Rules!</h2>
        
    <p> The rules to our game were really simple and understandable: 
        <ul>
            <li> 1. Whoever rolls the highest number goes first. The rest of the players will roll and the order of play will be from greatest number to lowest number. </li>
        <li> 

            <li> 2. Roll the dice and then see what number you get. All the directions you move are dependent on what you land on the game board. </li>
        <li> 3. If you roll and land on the arrow, you roll again to determine the direction </li>
        <li> 4. Then, you move the amount that you roll. When it gets towards the end or by the finish line, if you roll too many at the star on the board, you have to go all the way back around. </li>
        <li> 5. After going around the board at a maximum of two times, once you get to the outlined red square, you can stay in it until you get to the finish line. </li>
        <li> 6. NOTE: When you go around the square at least 2 times, then you can go to the finish line on the final roll even if the number exceeds the amount of spaces you need to reach the finish line. </li>
        <li> 7. NOTE: The big dot on the board means that you need to land exactly on it to get moved to the 4-6 square. </li>
</ul>
