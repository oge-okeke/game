        <h1>About the Game Creator!</h1>
        <p>
          My name is Oge Okeke and I am a current senior attending the Engineering and Science University Magnet School in West Haven, CT. Outside of school, I dance and have been dancing for 14 years. Other than dance, I like to hang out with my friends and watch Dance moms, which happens to be my favorite show.
